This is because bubble sort uses nested loops to compare adjacent elements and swap them if they are in the wrong order. In the worst case, the outer loop runs n times, and the inner loop runs n-1 times on the first iteration, n-2 times on the second iteration, and so on. Therefore, the total number of comparisons is (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 2 + 1 = n(n-1)/2, which is O(n^2) in big O notation.<br>\n",
